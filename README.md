# DataFusion on Ray

> This was originally a research project donated from  [ray-sql](https://github.com/datafusion-contrib/ray-sql) to evaluate performing distributed SQL queries from Python, using
[Ray](https://www.ray.io/) and [DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion).

DataFusion Ray is a distributed SQL query engine powered by the Rust implementation of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) and [Ray](https://www.ray.io/).

## Goals

- Demonstrate how easily new systems can be built on top of DataFusion. See the [design documentation](./docs/README.md)
  to understand how RaySQL works.
- Drive requirements for DataFusion's [Python bindings](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion-python).
- Create content for an interesting blog post or conference talk.

## Non Goals

- Re-build the cluster scheduling systems like what [Ballista](https://datafusion.apache.org/ballista/) did. 
  - Ballista is extremely complex and utilizing Ray feels like it abstracts some of that complexity away.
  - Datafusion Ray is delegating cluster management to Ray.

## Example

Run the following example live in your browser using a Google Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tmSX0Lu6UFh58_-DBUVoyYx6BoXHOszP?usp=sharing).

```python
import os
import pandas as pd
import ray

from datafusion_ray import RaySqlContext

SCRIPT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))

# Start a local cluster
ray.init(resources={"worker": 1})

# Create a context and register a table
ctx = RaySqlContext(2, use_ray_shuffle=True)
# Register either a CSV or Parquet file
# ctx.register_csv("tips", f"{SCRIPT_DIR}/tips.csv", True)
ctx.register_parquet("tips", f"{SCRIPT_DIR}/tips.parquet")

result_set = ctx.sql(
  "select sex, smoker, avg(tip/total_bill) as tip_pct from tips group by sex, smoker"
)
for record_batch in result_set:
  print(record_batch.to_pandas())
```

## Status

- DataFusion Ray can run all queries in the TPC-H benchmark

## Features

- Mature SQL support (CTEs, joins, subqueries, etc) thanks to DataFusion
- Support for CSV and Parquet files

## Limitations

- Requires a shared file system currently. Check details [here](./docs/README.md#distributed-shuffle).

## Performance

This chart shows the performance of DataFusion Ray compared to Apache Spark for
[SQLBench-H](https://sqlbenchmarks.io/sqlbench-h/) at a very small data set (10GB), running on a desktop (Threadripper
with 24 physical cores). Both DataFusion Ray and Spark are configured with 24 executors.

### Overall Time

DataFusion Ray is ~1.9x faster overall for this scale factor and environment with disk-based shuffle.

### Per Query Time

Spark is much faster on some queries, likely due to broadcast exchanges, which DataFusion Ray hasn't implemented yet.

### Performance Plan

Plans on experimenting with the following changes to improve performance:

- Make better use of Ray futures to run more tasks in parallel
- Use Ray object store for shuffle data transfer to reduce disk I/O cost
- Keep upgrading to newer versions of DataFusion to pick up the latest optimizations

## Building

```bash
# prepare development environment (used to build wheel / install in development)
python3 -m venv venv
# activate the venv
source venv/bin/activate
# update pip itself if necessary
python -m pip install -U pip
# install dependencies (for Python 3.8+)
python -m pip install -r requirements-in.txt
```

Whenever rust code changes (your changes or via `git pull`):

```bash
# make sure you activate the venv using "source venv/bin/activate" first
maturin develop
python -m pytest
```

## Benchmarking

Create a release build when running benchmarks, then use pip to install the wheel.

```bash
maturin develop --release
```

## How to update dependencies

To change test dependencies, change the `requirements.in` and run

```bash
# install pip-tools (this can be done only once), also consider running in venv
python -m pip install pip-tools
python -m piptools compile --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt
```

To update dependencies, run with `-U`

```bash
python -m piptools compile -U --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt
```
